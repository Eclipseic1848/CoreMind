# Configuration and Schema Guide

## When to use it

Describe agents, tools, workflows, budgets, permissions, and quality profiles in one validated coremind.yaml file.

## Minimal example

```text
schemaVersion: 2
name: support-agent
agents:
  main:
    systemPrompt: 你是客服助手
permissions:
  mode: ask
  workspaceOnly: true
  network: ask
runtime:
  maxTurns: 12
quality:
  profile: standard
```

## Verification

1. Follow the [SOP](SOP.en.md).
2. Run the [module example](../../../examples/modules/configure-coremind/README.en.md).
3. Run `coremind check`; also run `coremind eval` for business outputs.
4. Inspect failure status, budgets, traces, approvals, and checkpoints instead of judging only fluent text.

## Common mistakes

- Do not let the model invent business rules for the owner.
- Do not treat one successful run as stability evidence.
- Do not use full mode to bypass configured deny rules, audit, checkpoints, or recovery. Path-aware file tools enforce workspace policy; arbitrary shell execution has separate platform limits.
- Do not describe inherited providers as genuinely certified.
